# option-hedging-strategies-using-DEEP-Q-NETWORK-and-DDPG-with-rbergomi-model
This project focus on rough delta hedging using DQN
## Basic Ideas
done work has been summary in document [summary report](https://github.com/ziminghunmphrey/option-hedging-strategies-using-DEEP-Q-NETWORK-and-DDPG-with-rbergomi-model/blob/ziminghunmphrey-patch-1/project%2Bsummary.pdf) 
i) Calibrated rough Bergomi model (rough fractional SV) and implemented it to price European vanilla options using Monte Carlo method \n
ii) Developed the deep Q-networkalgorithm for optimalhedgingwith transaction costs to significantly reduce option replication expenses
