# option-hedging-strategies-using-DEEP-Q-NETWORK-and-DDPG-with-rbergomi-model
This project focus on rough delta hedging using DQN
## Basic Ideas
Done work has been summary in document [summary report](https://github.com/ziminghunmphrey/option-hedging-strategies-using-DEEP-Q-NETWORK-and-DDPG-with-rbergomi-model/blob/ziminghunmphrey-patch-1/project%2Bsummary.pdf)  
i) Calibrated rough Bergomi model (rough fractional SV) and implemented it to price European vanilla options using Monte Carlo method  
ii) Developed the deep Q-network algorithm for optimal hedging with transaction costs to significantly reduce option replication expenses  
Will Do 
iii) Developed the DDPG algorithm for optimal hedging with transaction costs to significantly reduce option replication expenses
iv) compare the performance among DDPG, DQN and traditional delta hedging strategies
